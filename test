We are always open. Always. During national holidays, week-end, national mourning days, and even when public transportation services are on strike.

But what if we decide to be closed for one day and create our own public holiday? After all, what is stopping us to do so?

We are part of the maker nation. We are the citizens of our own nation. We make our own rules. We have our own beers. We are not the property of any other group. We can do whatever we want (as long as it’s not forbidden by the Maker Nation Guidelines and the Universe).

So, for the second time this year, let’s create our own public holiday.

We are overly excited to officially announce that the 8th of October will be the 2018 Doctor Who Maker Nation Public Holiday.
To celebrate this special day, you can stay in bed and watch the new Doctor Who, or come to the workshop and make Doctor Who related-only builds.
